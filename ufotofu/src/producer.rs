//! Producers â€” values that asynchronously yield a sequence of items.
//!
//! [`Producer`] is an asynchronous generalisation of [`Iterator`]; a producer lazily produces a sequence of items. There are three core differences between [`Iterator::next`] and the analogous [`Producer::produce`]:
//!
//! - `produce` is asynchronous;
//! - `produce` returns a result, allowing it to report fatal errors; and
//! - `produce` uses an [`Either`] to distinguish between repeated items ([`Left`]) and the final value ([`Right`]).
//!
//! ```
//! use ufotofu::prelude::*;
//! # pollster::block_on(async{
//! let mut my_first_producer = [1, 2, 4].into_producer();
//!
//! assert_eq!(my_first_producer.produce().await?, Left(1));
//! assert_eq!(my_first_producer.produce().await?, Left(2));
//! assert_eq!(my_first_producer.produce().await?, Left(4));
//! assert_eq!(my_first_producer.produce().await?, Right(()));
//! # Result::<(), Infallible>::Ok(())
//! # });
//! ```
//!
//! Whereas an *iterator* yields a sequence of arbitrarily many values of type [`Iterator::Item`] followed by up to one value of type `()`, a producer yields a sequence of arbitrarily many values of type [`Producer::Item`] followed by either up to one value of type [`Producer::Final`] or by up to one value of type [`Producer::Error`]. Producers with `Final = ()` and `Error = Infallible` are effectively asynchronous iterators.
//!
//! It is forbidden to call `produce` after a producer has emitted an error or its final value. Any such call may result in unspecified (but safe) behaviour.
//!
//! <br/>
//!
//! The [`IntoProducer`] trait describes types which can be converted into producers. The standard library counterpart to `IntoProducer` is [`IntoIterator`].
//!
//! <br/>
//!
//! Every producer may eagerly perform side-effects to make subsequent `produce` calls more efficient. The classic example of a buffering producer is a producer of bytes which reads a file from disk: it should most certainly prefetch many bytes at a time instead of reading them on demand.
//!
//! The [`slurp`](Producer::slurp) method lets calling code instruct the producer to perform preparatory side-effects, even without the need to actually produce any data yet.
//!
//! <br/>
//!
//! Every producer automatically implements the [`ProducerExt`] trait, which provides useful methods for working with producers.
//!
//! <br/>Producing a sequence one item at a time can be inefficient. The [`BulkProducer`] trait extends [`Producer`] with the ability to produce multiple items at a time. This is enabled by the [`BulkProducer::expose_items`] method. You pass to this method an async function as the sole argument. The bulk producer calls that function, passing it a non-empty slice of items. The function can process these items in any way, and then returns a pair of values: first, the number of items the producer should now consider as having been produced, and second, an arbitrary value, to be returned by the `expose_items` call.
//!
//! ```
//! use ufotofu::prelude::*;
//! # pollster::block_on(async{
//! let mut p = [1, 2, 4].into_producer();
//!
//! assert_eq!(p.expose_items(async |items| {
//!     assert_eq!(items, &[1, 2, 4]);
//!     return (3, "hi!");
//! }).await?, Left("hi!"));
//! assert_eq!(p.produce().await?, Right(()));
//!
//! // If we reported that we only processed two items, the producer would later emit the `4`:
//! let mut p2 = [1, 2, 4].into_producer();
//! assert_eq!(p2.expose_items(async |items| {
//!     assert_eq!(items, &[1, 2, 4]);
//!     return (2, "hi!");
//! }).await?, Left("hi!"));
//! assert_eq!(p2.produce().await?, Left(4));
//! # Result::<(), Infallible>::Ok(())
//! # });
//! ```
//!
//! <br/>
//!
//! Every bulk producer automatically implements the [`BulkProducerExt`] trait, which provides bulk-production-based variants of several methods of [`ProducerExt`]. These bulk versions are typically more efficient and should be preferred whenever possible.
//!
//! Of particular note is the [`BulkProducerExt::bulk_produce`] method, which builds on `expose_items` and reimplements the way that, e.g., [`std::io::Read`] emits multiple items at a time: `bulk_produce` takes a mutable slice as its input, and the producer reports how many items it copied (cloned) into it.
//!
//! ```
//! use ufotofu::prelude::*;
//! # pollster::block_on(async{
//! let mut p = [1, 2, 4].into_producer();
//! let mut buf = [0, 0];
//!
//! assert_eq!(p.bulk_produce(&mut buf[..]).await?, Left(2));
//! assert_eq!(buf, [1, 2]);
//! assert_eq!(p.bulk_produce(&mut buf[..]).await?, Left(1));
//! assert_eq!(buf, [4, 2]);
//! assert_eq!(p.bulk_produce(&mut buf[..]).await?, Right(()));
//! # Result::<(), Infallible>::Ok(())
//! # });
//! ```
//!
//! <br/>The counterpart to the [`producer`] module is the [`consumer`] module.
